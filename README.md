# Metal.. what?

Metalbabble.com (a classic NES reference) is a name Iâ€™ve used in conjunction with various projects over the years; including web design, animation, music, comics, and indy video games. If youâ€™re interested in any past projects, feel free to contact me. Metalbabble.com is all about jumping into new territories, and celebrating technology as a medium.
